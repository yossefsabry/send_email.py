<h2 align="center">send email => python || yossef</h2>

This Python code is sending an 📧 email with HTML formatting 🎨 using smtplib 📮.

It starts by setting up the 💌 email content - a subject, body text, sender and receiver email addresses. It gets a 🔑 password securely using getpass.

Then it creates an EmailMessage object 📥 and adds the sender, receiver, subject.

The fun part is the HTML 🖥️ - it allows adding a header, paragraph, image 🖼️, and link 🔗 with custom styling to the email. The HTML is attached to the message as an alternative version.

To send, it connects securely to Gmail 📠 using smtplib and SSL 🔒. It logs in with the sender's email and password, and then sends 📬 the formatted message string.

Finally it prints some 💬 to confirm the 📧 was sent successfully! 🎉

So in summary:

Email 📧
smtplib 📮
SSL 🔒
HTML 🖥️
Custom formatting 🎨
Attach image 🖼️ and link 🔗
Send and confirm 📬 💬 🎉
The code uses emoji-style 😄 formatting to create a fun, visual description of how the Python email script works! Let me know if this helps explain the key steps. 👍
